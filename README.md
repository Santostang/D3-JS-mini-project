# D3-JS-mini-project
These are all the mini-project that I did using D3.js.
Most of them are from the assigments and projects in course [INFO 5100 - Data-Driven Web Applications](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/).


1. **temperature data - from d3 to R plot**

The task is to translate one graph in R to D3/JS. The file temperature.html implements a visualization of three year-level summaries of the monthly temperature anomalies: min, max, and mean. Comments in the code identify groups of lines that correspond to R statements.

2. **job data - from R to d3 plot**

The task is to translate one graph in D3/JS to R. The file jobs.R creates a visualization of monthly data since 2007, with a line plot overlaid with points that indicate whether a number is preliminary or final.

3. **Distribution Simulation and central limit theorem - hw5**

There's an important result in statistics called the central limit theorem. It says that, under fairly mild conditions, the mean of a random sample from a distribution behaves like a Gaussian random variable, even if the distribution you're sampling from behaves nothing like a Gaussian. We're going to see if this is true for a number of different probability distributions.

4. **Simulate Projectile Motion**

Simulate projectile motion under the influence of gravity using a finite approximation, where we estimate a ski jumper's position every 0.2 seconds. (This method was the original use for the ENIAC electronic computer.) Physics review: keep track of the position (displacement), velocity, and acceleration for the x and y dimensions separately.
