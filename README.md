# D3-JS-mini-project
These are all the mini-project that I did using D3.js.
Most of them are from the assigments and projects in course [INFO 5100 - Data-Driven Web Applications](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/).


1. **temperature data - from d3 to R plot**

The task is to translate one graph in R to D3/JS. The file temperature.html implements a visualization of three year-level summaries of the monthly temperature anomalies: min, max, and mean. Comments in the code identify groups of lines that correspond to R statements.

2. **job data - from R to d3 plot**

The task is to translate one graph in D3/JS to R. The file jobs.R creates a visualization of monthly data since 2007, with a line plot overlaid with points that indicate whether a number is preliminary or final.

3. **Distribution Simulation and central limit theorem - hw5**

There's an important result in statistics called the central limit theorem. It says that, under fairly mild conditions, the mean of a random sample from a distribution behaves like a Gaussian random variable, even if the distribution you're sampling from behaves nothing like a Gaussian. We're going to see if this is true for a number of different probability distributions.

4. **Simulate Projectile Motion**

Simulate projectile motion under the influence of gravity using a finite approximation, where we estimate a ski jumper's position every 0.2 seconds. (This method was the original use for the ENIAC electronic computer.) Physics review: keep track of the position (displacement), velocity, and acceleration for the x and y dimensions separately.

5. **Class Flag Design**

Use SVG <path> elements to create a design for the course flag. You must include three enneagrams and position them using the transform attribute. You may use any additional shapes or patterns you can think of as long as you implement them using <path> elements. If you use a tool to generate coordinates for shapes, please cite that tool. You must also include the course motto: ESSE ET
VIDERI using a <text> element. Hint: for repeated shapes, write the coordinates once, copy it several times, and then use some combination of translate() and scale() transformations to place them.
